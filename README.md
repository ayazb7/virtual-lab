## 💡 Idea <a name = "idea"></a>

- Students often struggle with completing the practical tasks, due to difficulty of understanding and setting up the experiments.
- During development of this project, COVID restrictions meant students could not attent school to attempts the practicals.
- This application includes two major features:
  - Example animations for each practical, detailing the setup required and measurements to take
  - DIY feature for each practical to allow students to attempt the experiement themselves
- The main aim is to provide a platform for students to learn and attempt the practicals at home
- This project was done as part of the A-Level Computer Science NEA coursework
